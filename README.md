# ArtNet Nodes Management App

## Introduction
Welcome to the ArtNet Nodes Management App repository! This Flutter mobile application is designed for managing ArtNet nodes, configuring their network settings, and controlling DMX data transmission. The primary goal of this project is to facilitate personal development and experimentation, and it's intended for fun and educational purposes. **Please note that the app is still a work in progress and may not be fully functional yet**.

## What is Artnet
ArtNet is a protocol used in the entertainment and lighting industries to control and communicate with intelligent lighting fixtures, such as DMX-controlled stage lights. It allows for the transmission of lighting data, such as color, intensity, and position, over an Ethernet network. ArtNet enables lighting designers and technicians to remotely control and synchronize multiple lighting devices, making it a popular choice for creating dynamic and visually appealing lighting displays in concerts, theaters, events, and architectural installations.

## Features
- **Discover ArtNet Nodes:**: Scan the local network to discover available ArtNet nodes and display them in a list.

- **Network Settings:** Connect to an ArtNet node and configure its network settings, such as IP address, subnet mask, and gateway.

- **ArtNet Settings:** Adjust various ArtNet-specific parameters like universe, subnet, and other configurations.

- **DMX Data Transmission:** Send DMX data to the connected ArtNet nodes, allowing you to control lighting fixtures remotely.

## Disclaimer
This app is not intended for production use and may not have all the necessary features for a complete and polished ArtNet nodes management solution. It is solely meant for educational and personal development purposes. Use it at your own risk.
